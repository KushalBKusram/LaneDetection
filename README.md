## Lane Detection

### Description
A simple Lane Detection algorithm implemented in Python using OpenCV techinques. This repository consists of a Jupyter Notebook that has cell-by-cell code snippets to eventually detect lanes in a given clip that may be recorded from the dashboard of a moving car. The notebook in this repo walks you through each step, comments along the code is self explanatory.  

### Requirements
Jupyter Notebook, Python, OpenCV, Matplotlib, NumPy and MoviePy

### Usage
1. Clone the repository. </br>
2. Open the directory with Jupyter Notebook and open **[Lane Detection.ipynb](https://github.com/KushalBKusram/LaneDetection/blob/master/LaneDetector.ipynb)** </br>
3. Proceed to run each cell. </br>
4. You are free to try my pipeline on your own clips. The code cells present in **Clips** section will help you.
